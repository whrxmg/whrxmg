- 👋 Hi, I’m @whrxmg
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to build code and apps that help me not work so hard. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web app coding and AI coding with python etc. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any evil sounding plans that don't hurt anyone but rich people. 
- 📫 How to reach me smoke signals usually work. 
- 😄 Pronouns: Any if you buy me breakfast. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: There isn't really any such thing as countries, we're all just people meat sacks trying to get ahead.
